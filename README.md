### Backend Setup:
1. Open the project within your chosen Integrated Development Environment (IDE), such as Eclipse.
2. If you are running the project for the first time, make sure to modify the 'application.properties' file by setting 'spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create' to facilitate the initial setup. For subsequent runs, use 'spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update'.
3. Start the Spring Boot application, which will run locally on your machine, accessible via port 8082.

Please ensure that you follow these setup steps meticulously to guarantee a successful implementation. For additional details and support, consult the individual folders within the repository.
